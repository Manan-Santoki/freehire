// talentCatalogHandlers serves the PUBLIC Talent Network catalogue: the filtered list of
// members, one member's card, and — when a member has uploaded one — a heavily blurred
// rendering of their photo. All three are unauthenticated by design — the catalogue is
// the front door of the feature, and a signed-out visitor is exactly who it is for — so
// none of the routes take any auth middleware.
//
// What they do take is a rate limiter. This is a small, complete, machine-readable set of
// people, which is precisely the thing worth copying in one evening; the limiter is the
// only thing standing between the catalogue and a copy of it.
