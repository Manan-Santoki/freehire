-- name: GetScreeningAnswers :one
-- The caller's single screening-answers record, keyed by user_id. No matching row means
-- the candidate has not stated any screening answer yet.
SELECT * FROM screening_answers
WHERE user_id = $1;

-- name: EnsureScreeningAnswersRow :execrows
-- Insert an all-unstated row for user_id if none exists yet; a no-op otherwise. Called
-- before GetScreeningAnswersForUpdate in the same transaction so that query always has a
-- row to lock — FOR UPDATE locks nothing on an absent row, which otherwise lets two
-- concurrent first-time Updates for the same brand-new user both read Answers{} and race an
-- unguarded INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE (see QueriesRepository.UpdateLocked). Two
-- concurrent callers inserting the same user_id serialize on the table's own unique index:
-- the second blocks until the first commits or rolls back, then sees the row (if committed)
-- and does nothing, or proceeds normally (if rolled back) — never a duplicate, never an error.
INSERT INTO screening_answers (user_id)
VALUES ($1)

-- name: GetScreeningAnswersForUpdate :one
-- Same as GetScreeningAnswers, but takes a row lock (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) for the rest
-- of the caller's transaction, so a concurrent Update for the same user_id blocks on this
-- SELECT until the first transaction commits instead of both reading the same stale row
-- and racing a lost update (see QueriesRepository.UpdateLocked). Always finds exactly one
-- row: the caller runs EnsureScreeningAnswersRow first in the same transaction, so there is
-- never a "no row to lock" case here.

-- name: UpsertScreeningAnswers :one
-- Create-or-replace the caller's one screening-answers record. Full-replace, mirroring
-- UpsertUserProfile: the service reads the current row, merges caller-provided fields over
-- it (omitted fields keep their stored value), and writes the merged result back whole —
-- so the SQL layer stays a plain upsert and the partial-update semantics live in Go, where
-- they are unit-testable without a database.
