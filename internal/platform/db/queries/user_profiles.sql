-- Create-or-replace the user's one profile. The PRIMARY KEY (user_id) makes this an
-- idempotent upsert: first save inserts, later saves overwrite specializations/skills/
-- seniorities/excluded_skills/excluded_sources/excluded_companies/location_preferences and
-- bump updated_at. All fields are already normalized by the service; seniorities,
-- excluded_skills, excluded_sources and excluded_companies may be empty;
-- location_preferences is a validated JSONB block or NULL (no preferences).

-- is computed in Go from a prior Get, outside any transaction: a Save() landing in that gap
-- must not be silently clobbered by a write built from a now-stale snapshot. No matching row
-- (updated_at moved, or the profile was deleted) returns zero rows; the caller re-reads and
-- retries rather than overwriting blind.

-- profile fingerprint, excluded_sources/excluded_companies feed the coarse exclude
-- filter, location_preferences feeds the fingerprint). user_profiles is a one-row-per-user
-- table with no expected high cardinality, so a full unpaged scan is the deliberately
-- simple choice here; revisit with a keyset cursor if that stops being true.
