// Repository is the persistence contract for the single per-user screening-answers
// record. Implementations map the generated db row to Answers, so the use case never sees
// db.*.
//
// Get maps a missing row to ErrNotFound — a plain, unlocked read for callers (Store.Get)
// that only display the record.
//
// UpdateLocked is the only write path, and it is atomic by construction: implementations
// must take an exclusive lock on the caller's row for the whole operation (a no-op when no
// row exists yet), call merge exactly once with what that locked read found (a fully
// unstated Answers{} when there is no row), and persist whatever merge returns before
// releasing the lock. That is what serializes two concurrent Update calls for the same
// userID onto one, race-free read-merge-write instead of each reading independently and
// whichever writes second clobbering the first (a lost update).

// Update sanitizes and validates the given fields, merges them over whatever the caller
// already has stored (a field the update leaves unset keeps its stored value), and
// persists the merged record. A caller with no existing record is treated as starting
// from a fully unstated one, so the first update is also a create.
//
// The read, merge and write happen as one atomic operation inside UpdateLocked (a row
// lock held for the whole transaction), not as separate Get/Upsert calls: two Updates
// racing for the same userID — the manual-edit handler and the assistant's
// screening_answers_set tool both call this same method — would otherwise both read the
// same "existing" record and the one that commits second would silently overwrite the
// first's fields instead of merging onto them.
