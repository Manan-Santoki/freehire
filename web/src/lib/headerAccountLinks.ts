// The header's own curated account items — what the signed-in user owns/reads,
// in the same order as the account sidebar (Profile itself is rendered
// separately by each consumer, so the full run reads Profile · Activity ·
// Tracking · Inbox · …). Shared by HeaderMenu's mobile drawer and
// HeaderProfileMenu's desktop panel so the two cannot drift apart, the way
// siteNav.ts's own comment describes happening before HEADER_LINKS/NAV were
// unified.
//
// Deliberately separate from accountNavIcons.ts, which maps the FULL account
// rail (every `/my/*` section) — this is a smaller, differently-curated
// subset for the header only, and the two disagree on purpose in places (e.g.
// "Search alerts" here targets `/my/notifications/searches`, a sub-page of
// the section accountNavIcons maps as a whole).
