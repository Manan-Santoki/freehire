// `h-[calc(100dvh-3.5rem)]` — the viewport minus the header — and carry their own
// left-edge icon rail, so a header centered inside `max-w-6xl` would float above a page
// that already reaches both screen edges. `+layout.svelte` also reads this to hide the
// footer, which belongs only here: a full-viewport shell has no room for one, but a page
// that merely wants a wider header (see isWideHeaderRoute below) is still an ordinary
// scrolling document that ends in one.
